# set -e: Causes the script to exit immediately if any command returns a non-zero exit status (an error). This prevents errors from being ignored and ensures failures are caught early.
# set -u: Treats unset variables as an error and exits immediately. This helps catch typos and missing variables that could lead to unexpected behavior.
# set -o pipefail: Ensures that a pipeline (a sequence of commands connected with |) fails if any command in the pipeline fails, not just the last one. By default, only the last commandâ€™s exit status is considered, which can mask earlier failures.

Useful NFS-related commands:
1. Show mounted NFS shares:          cat /proc/mounts | grep nfs
2. Check active NFS services:        systemctl status nfs-server
3. Restart NFS server:               systemctl restart nfs-server
4. Stop NFS server:                  systemctl stop nfs-server
5. Start NFS server:                 systemctl start nfs-server
6. Check NFS exports:                exportfs -v
7. Unmount an NFS share:             umount /mnt/nfs/nasX  (Replace X with the index)
8. Remove NFS mounts from fstab:     sed -i '/\/mnt\/nfs\/nas/d' /etc/fstab
9. List available NFS shares:        showmount -e localhost
10. Show NFS clients:                netstat -an | grep :2049
