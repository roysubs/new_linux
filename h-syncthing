# Syncthing Cheatsheet

## Introduction
Syncthing is a continuous file synchronization program that synchronizes files between two or more computers in real time, securely and without needing a cloud service.

## Installation

### Debian-based Systems
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install curl
Add Syncthing's official repository:
bash
Copy code
sudo apt install apt-transport-https
curl -s https://syncthing.net/release-key.txt | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb https://apt.syncthing.net/ syncthing stable" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install syncthing
Starting Syncthing
Start Syncthing as a background service:
bash
Copy code
systemctl --user start syncthing
Enable Syncthing to start on boot:
bash
Copy code
systemctl --user enable syncthing
Check Status
Verify if Syncthing is running:
bash
Copy code
systemctl --user status syncthing
Configuration
Accessing Web UI
Syncthing provides a web interface by default at http://localhost:8384. You can configure this from any machine with the appropriate IP address.
Adding Folders
On the web UI, go to Actions > Show ID and note the device ID for each device.
To add a folder to sync, go to the Folders tab and click Add Folder.
Select the folder path and specify the sync options.
Accepting Devices
Devices must be added by sharing device IDs between machines.
On the web UI, click on Devices and then Add Device. Enter the device ID from the other machine.
Folder Share Example
On first device: Add a folder and share it with another device (use the device ID shared earlier).
bash
Copy code
syncthing --folder <folder-path> --device <device-id>
Ignoring Files
To ignore specific files or directories, edit the .stignore file in the shared folder:
text
Copy code
*.bak
.tmp/
Operation
Syncing Files
Once devices are connected and folders are shared, files will sync automatically between all devices that have the shared folder.

Pause Syncing
Temporarily pause syncing for a folder:
bash
Copy code
syncthing --pause <folder-id>
Restart Syncthing
To restart Syncthing:
bash
Copy code
systemctl --user restart syncthing
Advanced Commands
Device Management
To remove a device:
bash
Copy code
syncthing --device <device-id> --remove
Status and Logs
To view Syncthing's status:
bash
Copy code
syncthing --status
To view logs:
bash
Copy code
journalctl -u syncthing -f
Security
Encryption
Syncthing automatically encrypts data during transit using TLS. No need for manual configuration.

Authentication
To secure the web UI with a username and password:
Go to the Settings > GUI tab in the web UI.
Set the username and password.
Firewall Configuration
Syncthing uses TCP/UDP port 22000 by default. Ensure it's open on your firewall to allow syncing between devices:
bash
Copy code
sudo ufw allow 22000/tcp
sudo ufw allow 22000/udp
Tips and Tricks
Running Syncthing as a System Service
To run Syncthing as a system-wide service, you can configure it with systemd:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl enable syncthing@<user>.service
Updating Syncthing
To update Syncthing, simply run:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade syncthing
Accessing Remote Web UI
To access a remote Syncthing instance securely, use SSH port forwarding:

bash
Copy code
ssh -L 8384:localhost:8384 user@remote-host
View Syncthing Logs
For troubleshooting or checking Syncthing's performance:

bash
Copy code
journalctl -u syncthing --since "1 hour ago"
