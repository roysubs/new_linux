For vimrc setup, if running on WSL, check if vim or nvim are installed.
If they are, offer to copy into 
/mnt/c/Users/XXXXX/AppData/Local/nvim/init.vim
and to
/mnt/c/Users/XXXXX/.vimrc

It should really do this output for you 


this is wrong, need to sort

Optional Enhancements for 'd'
Color output:
Use tput setaf N for colorizing headers, sizes, warnings.
Example: make "[Loose Files]" gray or italic.
Depth control:
Currently only scans direct children. Add a --depth N to allow scanning sub-subdirectories.
JSON output option (--json):
Useful for piping data into other scripts or tools.
Interactive mode:
Add an --interactive flag to allow expanding into subdirs.
Parallelization:
Consider using GNU Parallel or backgrounding du calls for large directories.
Smart bar scaling:
Right now, small items get invisible bars. Consider a log scale or minimum bar width.
Would you like me to turn this into a reusable tool with a man page and bash-completion file, or help modularize it into functions for maintainability?
