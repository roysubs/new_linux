ðŸ›  Optional Enhancements You Might Consider
Color output:

Use tput setaf N for colorizing headers, sizes, warnings.

Example: make "[Loose Files]" gray or italic.

Depth control:

Currently only scans direct children. Add a --depth N to allow scanning sub-subdirectories.

JSON output option (--json):

Useful for piping data into other scripts or tools.

Interactive mode:

Add an --interactive flag to allow expanding into subdirs.

Parallelization:

Consider using GNU Parallel or backgrounding du calls for large directories.

Smart bar scaling:

Right now, small items get invisible bars. Consider a log scale or minimum bar width.

Would you like me to turn this into a reusable tool with a man page and bash-completion file, or help modularize it into functions for maintainability?
