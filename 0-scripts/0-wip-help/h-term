By default, in terminal:
Ctrl+Shift+c to copy selected text into clipboard
Ctrl+Shift+v to paste from clipboard into a terminal

If not, Terminal preferences are usually in right-click inside the terminal, then Preferences or Settings, or in the menu bar Edit > Preferences.
Look for the Shortcuts section and ensure "Paste" is mapped to Ctrl+Shift+V.
