How to recover the last version of a file that was deleted
I accidentally deleted README.md, so use this to recover from the online repo:
#    git checkout origin/main -- README.md

origin/main   # the main branch of the remote repository
-- README.md  # specifies that you want to restore only the README.md file from the latest commit on the remote branch.

If you are unsure about the branch that you are on:
#    git branch
