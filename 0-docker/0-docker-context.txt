I'm on windows so I don't have .bashrc, well, I do in WSL, would you say that Docker Desktop is basically pointing at WSL most of the time anyway?

‚úÖ Yes

How do I get Docker Desktop on my Windows system to manage my containers at 192.168.1.140 ?
You can't; Docker Desktop manages only the local environment.
To manage the remote environment, using Portainer is best.

‚úÖ However, you can set the CLI context to talk to the remote Docker daemon and it is listening over TCP (not default; must be enabled), and you have SSH access or TLS certs for secure connection.

Option 1: Via SSH (recommended and secure)
If you can SSH into the remote host:
    export DOCKER_HOST=ssh://user@192.168.1.140
Now, docker ps will show containers on the remote machine.
To make this persistent:
    echo 'export DOCKER_HOST=ssh://user@192.168.1.140' >> ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc
üõ†Ô∏è This requires no special Docker daemon config as long as SSH is set up.

Option 2: TCP socket (less secure, needs Docker daemon config)
If you want to expose Docker over TCP (not recommended unless secured with TLS):
    On 192.168.1.140, edit the Docker daemon systemd unit:
    sudo systemctl edit docker
Add this to the override file:
    [Service]
    ExecStart=
    ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd -H fd:// -H tcp://0.0.0.0:2375
Reload and restart Docker:
    sudo systemctl daemon-reexec
    sudo systemctl restart docker
On your local machine:
    export DOCKER_HOST=tcp://192.168.1.140:2375
üö® WARNING: This is insecure unless protected with TLS or a firewall.

üì¶ Docker Desktop integration (context-aware)
Docker Desktop supports contexts. You can create a new context for a remote Docker engine:

docker context create remote140 --docker "host=ssh://boss@192.168.1.140"
Then switch to it:   docker context use remote140
To see your active context:   docker context ls

Summary: Don't change docker engine JSON for this purpose.
Use DOCKER_HOST or Docker contexts to talk to remote Docker hosts.
Prefer ssh:// for security and ease of use.



ChatGPT said:
Yes, on Windows, Docker Desktop does use WSL2 under the hood to run the Linux Docker daemon and containers. Here's a breakdown:

üîß Docker Desktop Architecture on Windows (WSL2 mode)
Docker Desktop runs a lightweight Linux VM inside WSL2.

The Docker daemon (dockerd) runs inside WSL2 (usually in the docker-desktop or docker-desktop-data distro).

The Docker CLI on Windows (e.g., in PowerShell or CMD) communicates with the daemon inside WSL via a special context (default).

If you open WSL (e.g., Ubuntu), you can also run docker commands because Docker Desktop integrates the CLI into WSL by default.

So where should you configure DOCKER_HOST?
üëâ Option A: For WSL terminals (Ubuntu, Debian, etc.)
If you're running Docker from within WSL, yes, use .bashrc, .zshrc, or .profile:
    echo 'export DOCKER_HOST=ssh://user@192.168.1.140' >> ~/.bashrc
    source ~/.bashrc
This affects Docker CLI usage within WSL only.

üëâ Option B: For Windows terminals (PowerShell, CMD)
Set the environment variable in PowerShell or system-wide:

    $env:DOCKER_HOST = "ssh://user@192.168.1.140"
To persist it:
Use System Environment Variables:
Open System Properties ‚Üí Environment Variables.
Add a new user variable:
Name: DOCKER_HOST
Value: ssh://user@192.168.1.140
Now, all Docker CLI invocations in Windows will point to the remote host.

üß† TL;DR
Yes, Docker Desktop points at WSL in most cases.
Configure DOCKER_HOST in WSL if you use Docker from WSL.
Configure it in Windows Env Vars if you use Docker from PowerShell/CMD.
Use docker context if you want a clean, switchable setup that works in both environments.
Would you like a step-by-step on setting up a Docker context from Windows to your remote server?



ok, I've changed WSL bashrc and sourced it, so how do I get docker desktop to look at my containers on 192.168.1.140?


ChatGPT said:
Great ‚Äî you've set up DOCKER_HOST=ssh://user@192.168.1.140 in WSL, so now your WSL terminal will point at the remote Docker host. However, Docker Desktop itself will still point to its internal Docker daemon running inside WSL, not your remote host.

Here‚Äôs how to get Docker Desktop to manage containers at 192.168.1.140, meaning view and control them via its GUI and CLI:

‚úÖ Option 1: Use a Docker context
This is the cleanest and most Docker-native way to do it ‚Äî and it works in both WSL and Windows.

üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-step:
In your WSL terminal (where DOCKER_HOST is set) or PowerShell:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker context create remote140 \
  --docker "host=ssh://user@192.168.1.140"
This creates a named context pointing to your remote Docker daemon via SSH.

Switch to that context:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker context use remote140
Verify:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker info
You should see info from the remote host (like its kernel, containers, etc.).

Open Docker Desktop ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Docker Engine
You cannot directly set the context here. But you can:

Open Docker Desktop

Click the whale icon in the system tray

Go to "Docker Contexts"

Select remote140 (if available ‚Äî feature varies by version)

If you don't see the GUI context switcher, Docker Desktop will still respect your context in terminals, but not in the GUI.

‚ùå Docker Desktop GUI Limitation
As of now, Docker Desktop GUI cannot fully browse/manage containers on remote contexts (like ssh://host). The GUI is tightly coupled to its internal Docker daemon.

So:

‚úÖ You can use docker ps, docker compose, etc., in WSL or PowerShell and point to the remote.

‚ùå You cannot use the Docker Desktop GUI to browse/manage containers on 192.168.1.140.

‚úÖ Alternative: Use Portainer (web GUI for remote Docker)
If you want a GUI to manage your remote Docker daemon:

Deploy Portainer on 192.168.1.140:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker volume create portainer_data
docker run -d -p 9000:9000 -p 8000:8000 \
  --name=portainer --restart=always \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -v portainer_data:/data \
  portainer/portainer-ce
Open http://192.168.1.140:9000 in your browser to access a full-featured GUI for Docker on that host.

Summary
Feature	Docker CLI (WSL)	Docker Desktop GUI
Remote container management	‚úÖ via SSH context	‚ùå not supported
Context switching	‚úÖ	Limited support
GUI for remote Docker	‚ùå	‚ùå (use Portainer)

Would you like help setting up Portainer or automating this with Ansible/Docker Compose?

ChatGPT said:
You're very close ‚Äî the error message tells us exactly what's going wrong:

‚ùå Problem:
text
Copy
Edit
ssh_askpass: exec(/usr/bin/ssh-askpass): No such file or directory
Host key verification failed.
This means:

SSH is trying to ask for a password, but you're not using an SSH agent or key-based auth.

Since you‚Äôre in a non-GUI WSL shell, it can‚Äôt pop up a password prompt, and fails.

‚úÖ Solution: Use SSH key authentication
To fix this, set up passwordless SSH access using an SSH key pair:

üîê 1. Check if you already have a key
In WSL:

bash
Copy
Edit
ls ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
If it exists, you're good. If not, generate one:

bash
Copy
Edit
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
(Just hit enter through the prompts for default path and no passphrase.)

üì§ 2. Copy your public key to the remote server
bash
Copy
Edit
ssh-copy-id boss@192.168.1.140
If ssh-copy-id isn't installed, do it manually:

bash
Copy
Edit
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh boss@192.168.1.140 'mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys && chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys'
Test it:

bash
Copy
Edit
ssh boss@192.168.1.140
You should log in without a password now.

üîÑ 3. Unset DOCKER_HOST in your .bashrc
Since you‚Äôre now using Docker contexts, not direct DOCKER_HOST, edit .bashrc and remove or comment out:

bash
Copy
Edit
# export DOCKER_HOST=ssh://boss@192.168.1.140
Then apply it:

bash
Copy
Edit
source ~/.bashrc
‚ñ∂Ô∏è 4. Re-try Docker with the context
bash
Copy
Edit
docker context use remote140
docker info
You should now see Docker info from the remote machine.

‚úÖ Optional: Use SSH agent for passphrased keys
If your key has a passphrase and you're tired of typing it, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
(You can add this to your .bashrc if needed.)

Would you like a script to automate this entire SSH setup?

You said:
ok, well, I've done all this, and Docker Desktop is still just pointing at my local windows machine


ChatGPT said:
That‚Äôs expected ‚Äî and here‚Äôs the key point:

Docker Desktop‚Äôs GUI can only manage its own local Docker daemon.
It does not support managing remote Docker daemons via SSH contexts in the GUI.

üîç What‚Äôs going on:
You've successfully set up:

‚úÖ Passwordless SSH to 192.168.1.140

‚úÖ A working docker context named remote140

‚úÖ Docker CLI (inside WSL or Windows) can now talk to that remote Docker host

But:

‚ùå Docker Desktop GUI (the whale tray icon / container list) will still show containers running on your local machine only.

This is a limitation of Docker Desktop itself ‚Äî the GUI is hardwired to its own local WSL2-based Docker engine.

‚úÖ What you can do now:
Task	CLI (WSL or PowerShell)	Docker Desktop GUI
Manage remote containers	‚úÖ (via docker context)	‚ùå Not supported
Switch between local/remote	‚úÖ docker context use	‚ùå GUI is fixed to local
GUI to manage remote Docker	üëâ Use Portainer instead	‚ùå Not supported

üß≠ How to manage the remote server graphically?
Here‚Äôs what I recommend:

üî∏ Install Portainer on the remote machine
You‚Äôll get a full-featured web GUI to manage all containers on 192.168.1.140:

bash
Copy
Edit
ssh boss@192.168.1.140 <<'EOF'
docker volume create portainer_data
docker run -d -p 9000:9000 -p 8000:8000 \
  --name=portainer --restart=always \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -v portainer_data:/data \
  portainer/portainer-ce
EOF
Then open in your browser:

cpp
Copy
Edit
http://192.168.1.140:9000
Would you like me to add this Portainer deployment to your setup script or create a separate one-liner for it?







You said:
haha, but my original question was how to get docker desktop to manage my remote system :) it's ok, if you are saying it's impossible, I'm fine with that, at least I know


ChatGPT said:
üòÖ Yup ‚Äî you‚Äôre absolutely right to laugh.

And to answer clearly and finally:

üö´ Docker Desktop cannot manage remote Docker daemons over SSH in its GUI.

Even though docker context works in the CLI, the Desktop GUI is hardcoded to its local Docker engine inside WSL2. No setting in the Docker Desktop "Engine" JSON or otherwise will make it talk to a remote Docker daemon.

‚úÖ What does work:
CLI with docker context (what you‚Äôve set up)

Web GUI via Portainer, running on the remote host

Docker Desktop extensions, but they still operate on the local engine

If GUI-based remote Docker control is a must, Portainer is the de facto standard.

Want help customizing Portainer deployment (e.g., reverse proxy it behind HTTPS, secure it with auth, etc.)?







You said:
I have 2x entries for WSL Ubuntu in my Windows Terminal. One sees docker on the console, and one does not?!? 


ChatGPT said:
Ah, that‚Äôs a classic Windows Terminal + WSL gotcha.

You're likely seeing two profiles for the same Ubuntu distro, but with different environments. Here's what's probably happening:

üß† TL;DR:
One of the entries starts Ubuntu inside the Docker Desktop WSL context, and the other starts it normally. Only the Docker WSL has Docker working locally.

üß© Why this happens
Docker Desktop installs a special WSL2 distro (called something like docker-desktop and docker-desktop-data) and also integrates with your user distros (e.g. Ubuntu) by injecting the Docker CLI and socket into the environment.

But that only happens in:

The default terminal session launched via Docker Desktop

A WSL session where the Docker environment is correctly initialized (via ~/.bashrc, /etc/profile.d/docker.sh, or Windows Terminal profile setup)

üß™ Check which WSL you're in
In each Ubuntu terminal, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
wslpath "C:\\" && uname -a && echo $PATH
Also:

bash
Copy
Edit
ps -e | grep dockerd
And:

bash
Copy
Edit
printenv | grep -i DOCKER
You might see that one terminal has things like:

bash
Copy
Edit
DOCKER_HOST=unix:///var/run/docker.sock
and the other does not.

ü©∫ Fix It
1. Open Windows Terminal settings ‚Üí look at both Ubuntu entries.
Check if one has a "commandline" like:

json
Copy
Edit
"commandline": "wsl.exe ~"
and the other has something odd like:

json
Copy
Edit
"commandline": "wsl.exe -d Ubuntu"
They might be targeting different launch configs ‚Äî but both still launch the same distro.

2. Inside Ubuntu, run:
bash
Copy
Edit
wsl.exe -l -v
Make sure your active Ubuntu instance is the default. If not:

bash
Copy
Edit
wsl.exe --set-default Ubuntu
3. Clean up old profiles if needed
You can remove or merge the duplicate entries in Windows Terminal's settings UI or JSON (settings.json) under profiles.list.

‚úÖ Best practice
Stick to one Ubuntu profile

If you want Docker access in it, make sure your ~/.bashrc (or ~/.profile) contains something like:

bash
Copy
Edit
export DOCKER_HOST=unix:///var/run/docker.sock
...or better yet, nothing at all ‚Äî let Docker Desktop set things up.

Would you like help merging your two terminal profiles into one consistent setup?
