# 🛡️ D&D 5e Combat Basics – Beginner’s Guide

## 🎯 Overview

Combat in Dungeons & Dragons 5e is turn-based and organized by initiative order. Each participant takes a turn during each **round**, which typically lasts about 6 seconds in game time.

---

## ⚔️ Step-by-Step Combat

### 1. **Initiative**

- At the start of combat, everyone rolls **1d20 + DEX modifier**.  
>  **DEX modifier** = (DEX score − 10) ÷ 2 (rounded down).  
- Highest result acts first, then in descending order.  
  If there is a tie-break, the character with the higher DEX mod acts first.  
  If still a tie-break, those tied re-roll initiative to break the tie.  
  If still a tie-break, it can be a simultaneous action, but this is rare.  
- Each participant completes their turn before the next begins.  
> Turns are taken in initiative order and all characters take 1 action by default.

---

### 2. **Your Turn**

**Combat Rounds**:
   - Each round represents 6 seconds of in-game time.
   - During a round, each participant takes a turn, starting with the highest initiative.

#### 🏃 Movement

- You may move up to your **Speed**.
- Default Speed by race:
  - **Human, Elf, Half-Elf, Dragonborn, Tiefling**: 30 ft
  - **Dwarf, Gnome, Halfling**: 25 ft
  - **Tabaxi**: 30 ft (but has Feline Agility to double)
  - **Movement modifiers**: Class features, feats, encumbrance, or magic.

#### ⚔️ Action (1 per turn)

Examples:
- **Attack**: Make a melee or ranged weapon attack.
- **Cast a Spell**: Use a spell with a 1-action cast time.
- **Dash**: Double your movement this turn.
- **Disengage**: Move without triggering opportunity attacks.
- **Dodge**: Enemies have disadvantage to hit you; you get advantage on DEX saves.
- **Help**: Grant advantage to an ally’s next check/attack.
- **Hide**: Make a DEX (Stealth) check.
- **Ready**: Prepare a reaction.
- **Search**: Look around using WIS or INT.
- **Use Object**: Pull lever, open door, drink potion, etc.


#### ➕ Bonus Action

Granted by:
- **Class features**:
  - Rogue: Cunning Action (Dash, Disengage, Hide)
  - Monk: Martial Arts
  - Bard: Bardic Inspiration
- **Spells**:
  - *Misty Step*, *Healing Word*, *Spiritual Weapon*

> 🧠 You can use **1 action** and **1 bonus action** per turn (if available).

#### 🔁 Reaction

Used **once per round**, outside your turn, in response to a trigger.

Examples:
- **Opportunity Attack**: When an enemy leaves your reach.
- **Shield**: Cast to boost AC until start of next turn.
- **Counterspell**: Interrupt another caster’s spell.

### 3. **Making an Attack**

#### 🎯 Attack Roll

Roll: **1d20 + attack bonus**

**Attack bonus = Proficiency Bonus + relevant stat modifier (STR or DEX)**

- **STR**: Melee weapons (e.g. longsword, greataxe)
- **DEX**: Ranged weapons (e.g. bow, crossbow) or finesse weapons (e.g. dagger, rapier)

#### 💥 Damage Roll

- Roll weapon’s damage dice + stat modifier.
  - **STR** for melee.
  - **DEX** for finesse or ranged.
- Example: A longsword (1d8) with STR 16 (+3) → **1d8+3 slashing**

#### 🔍 Weapon Properties

- **Finesse**: Use STR or DEX for attack/damage (player’s choice).
- **Versatile**: Use 2 hands for higher damage (e.g. longsword 1d8/1d10).
- **Heavy**: Not suitable for Small creatures. Often used with Great Weapon Fighting.
- **Light**: Suitable for two-weapon fighting (dual wielding).
- **Reach**: Attack from 10 feet away.
- **Thrown (20/60)**: Use STR or DEX for ranged attacks.

---

### 4. **Critical Hits and Misses**

- **Natural 20**: Auto hit, roll double the damage dice.
- **Natural 1**: Auto miss.

---

### 5. **Ending Combat**

Combat ends when:
- All enemies are defeated, captured, or have fled.
- A peaceful resolution is achieved.
- The DM says so.
