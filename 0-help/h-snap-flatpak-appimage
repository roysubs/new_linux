Alternatives to Flatpak
If you’re looking for lightweight package management, stick with:

APT: Native Debian package management is the most efficient and lightweight.
AppImage: These are portable, self-contained application bundles that don’t require daemons or services. They don’t integrate with the system as smoothly as Flatpak but avoid background resource usage entirely.
