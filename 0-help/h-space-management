### ncdu (Recommended)
This is an interactive disk usage analyzer that provides a nice overview of space usage in a directory.
Install it (if not already installed):
`sudo apt install ncdu`
Run it on the root directory (/):
`sudo ncdu /`
Use arrow keys to navigate (left to go up a directory), q to quit, ? to see help.

### du (Basic, but powerful)
If you prefer built-in tools, du (disk usage) is available by default:
`sudo du -ahx / | sort -rh | head -20`
This shows the top 20 largest files and folders in / from which you can drill into folders and rerun.
To scan only a specific directory (like /home):
`sudo du -h --max-depth=1 /home | sort -h`

### df (To see overall disk usage)
To check which partitions are using space:
`df -hT`
This gives an overview of all mounted filesystems.

### find (To locate huge files)
If you suspect large individual files are causing the issue:
`sudo find / -type f -size +500M -exec ls -lh {} +`
This finds files larger than 500 MB.
