# Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition Combat Process Cheatsheet

## Combat Sequence
1. **Initiative**: 
   - Each participant rolls a d20 and adds their Dexterity modifier to determine the initiative order.
   - The DM decides the order for ties.

2. **Combat Rounds**:
   - Each round represents 6 seconds of in-game time.
   - During a round, each participant takes a turn, starting with the highest initiative.

## Actions in Combat
### Common Actions:
- **Attack**: Make a melee or ranged attack.
- **Cast a Spell**: Cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action.
- **Dash**: Double your movement for the turn.
- **Disengage**: Your movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks for the rest of the turn.
- **Dodge**: Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against you has disadvantage if you can see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving throws with advantage.
- **Help**: Grant an ally advantage on their next ability check or attack roll.
- **Hide**: Attempt to hide using a Dexterity (Stealth) check.
- **Ready**: Prepare to take an action when a specified trigger occurs.

### Attack Roll:
- Roll a d20 and add your attack bonus (Proficiency + Ability Modifier).
- Compare the result to the target’s AC (Armor Class).
- If the roll is equal to or higher, the attack hits.

### Damage Roll:
- Roll the damage dice for the weapon or spell and add the relevant modifier.
- Apply any resistances or vulnerabilities the target has.

### Critical Hits:
- When you roll a natural 20 on an attack roll, roll all the attack’s damage dice twice and add them together.

### Example of an Attack:
1. **Player**: "I attack the goblin with my longsword!"
2. **DM**: "Roll to hit."
3. **Player**: Rolls d20 + Attack bonus (d20 + 5) and gets 17.
4. **DM**: "That hits. Roll for damage."
5. **Player**: Rolls damage (1d8 + 3) and gets 6.
6. **DM**: "The goblin takes 6 points of damage."

## Movement
- Your speed in feet determines how far you can move during your turn.
- You can break up your movement and take it at any time during your turn.
- Moving through difficult terrain costs 1 extra foot of movement for every foot moved.

## Example Movement:
1. **Player**: "I move 15 feet to get within melee range of the goblin."
2. **DM**: "You can move and then take your action to attack."

## Conditions
### Common Conditions:
- **Blinded**: Can’t see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature’s attack rolls have disadvantage.
- **Grappled**: A grappled creature’s speed becomes 0.
- **Invisible**: An invisible creature is impossible to see without special means. Attack rolls against the creature have disadvantage, and the creature’s attack rolls have advantage.

### Example Table of Conditions:

| Condition   | Effect                                                                    |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Blinded     | Can’t see, attacks against have advantage, attacks have disadvantage.     |
| Grappled    | Speed becomes 0, can't benefit from bonuses to speed.                     |

2. **Check components**: Make sure you have the necessary material, verbal, or somatic components.
3. **Casting time**: Spells have a casting time, often 1 action.
4. **Range**: Determine if the target is within range.
