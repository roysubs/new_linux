using Vim, I recommend using a different plugin for autocompletion, such as YouCompleteMe or deoplete.

Steps to Install YouCompleteMe for Vim:
Install vim-plug if you haven't already:

bash
Copy code
curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim
Update .vimrc to include the plugin:

vim
Copy code
" Initialize vim-plug
call plug#begin('~/.vim/plugged')

" Install YouCompleteMe
Plug 'ycm-core/YouCompleteMe'

" End plugin section
call plug#end()
Install the Plugin: After updating your .vimrc, run this command inside Vim:

vim
Copy code
:PlugInstall
Install YouCompleteMe Dependencies: To get YouCompleteMe working, you need to install some additional dependencies, such as cmake and the specific language completers you want.

For example, to install the core dependencies for YouCompleteMe:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt install build-essential cmake python3-dev
Then, navigate to the plugin directory and compile YouCompleteMe:

bash
Copy code
cd ~/.vim/plugged/YouCompleteMe
python3 install.py --all
Restart Vim: Once everything is set up, restart Vim. You should now have autocompletion with YouCompleteMe!

Using YouCompleteMe:
Completion: As you type, YouCompleteMe will suggest completions. Press Tab to cycle through the suggestions.
Manual Trigger: You can trigger completion manually by pressing Ctrl-Space.
Let me know if you need further help with this setup!
