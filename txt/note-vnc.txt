The VNC server needs to know what commands to execute when it starts up. Specifically, VNC needs to know which graphical desktop it should connect to.

These commands are located in a configuration file called xstartup in the .vnc folder under your home directory. The startup script was created when you ran the vncserver command in the previous step, but you’ll create your own to launch the Xfce desktop.

When VNC is first set up, it launches a default server instance on port 5901. This port is called a display port, and is referred to by VNC as :1. VNC can launch multiple instances on other display ports, like :2, :3, and so on.

Because you are going to change how the VNC server is configured, first stop the VNC server instance that is running on port 5901 with the following command:

vncserver -kill :1


netstat -tuln | grep 590   # Should show it running on :5901
cat ~/.vnc/<hostname>:1.log

vncpasswd   # change the VNC passwords
chmod 600 ~/.vnc/passwd
vi ~/.vnc/config   # This may not exist

For testing, can disable view-only with
vncpasswd -viewonly

If none of the above works, completely clear and reconfigure the VNC password file:
rm ~/.vnc/passwd
vncpasswd




#!/bin/bash: The first line is a shebang. In executable plain-text files on *nix platforms, a shebang tells the system what interpreter to pass that file to for execution. In this case, you’re passing the file to the Bash interpreter. This will allow each successive line to be executed as commands, in order.

xrdb $HOME/.Xresources: This command tells VNC’s GUI framework to read the user’s .Xresources file. .Xresources is where a user can make changes to certain settings for the graphical desktop, like terminal colors, cursor themes, and font rendering.

startxfce4 &: This command tells the server to launch Xfce. This is where you will find all the graphical software that you need to comfortably manage your server.
