Vim can be awkward with compiled feature support like termguicursor etc
Neovim (nvim) has much better support for everything and is usually a better option for most situations.
alias vi=nvim

- Test if the console can handle changing the cursor:
echo -e "\e[6 q"  # Should change the cursor to a blinking bar
echo -e "\e[2 q"  # Should change it to a steady block


Advanced: Modify Terminal Configuration
If your terminal doesn't recognize Ctrl+Shift+Arrow, you can configure it to send specific escape sequences. Here's an example for some popular terminals:

For Xterm
Add the following to your .Xresources file:

plaintext
Copy code
XTerm*vt100.translations: #override \
  Shift Ctrl <KeyPress> Up: string(0x1b) string("[1;6A") \n\
  Shift Ctrl <KeyPress> Down: string(0x1b) string("[1;6B")
Reload the configuration:

bash
Copy code
xrdb ~/.Xresources
