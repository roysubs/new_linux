# BattleTech Combat Process Cheatsheet

## Initiative Phase
- Roll Initiative: `2d6 + Pilot Skill`
- Highest roll chooses to act first or second.
- If a tie, roll again.

## Movement Phase
- Declare movement: Determine movement mode (Walk, Run, Jump).
- Movement Cost:
  - Walk: 1 hex per movement point
  - Run: 2 hexes per movement point
  - Jump: Varies by Jump Jets
- Movement modifiers:
  - Terrain: Woods, Water, Hills, etc.
  - Enemy units: Move through engagement zones for penalties.
- End movement in cover if possible (woods, buildings, etc.).

## Weapon Attack Phase
- Declare Attacks: Choose targets within range.
- Weapon selection: Choose from available weapons based on the range to target (Short, Medium, Long).
- Roll to hit: `2d6 + Target Number (TN)`
  - Target Numbers depend on:
    - Range to target
    - Target movement modifier
    - Obstructions (cover, terrain)
    - Piloting skill
- Determine hit location: `2d6` to determine where the shot hits on the target's body (head, torso, limbs).

## Damage Resolution
- Apply damage: Check hit location chart to apply damage to specific body parts.
- Armor check: If the hit location has armor, subtract damage from armor.
  - If armor is destroyed, apply damage to internal structure.
- Internal damage: Damage that exceeds armor is applied to internal structure, possibly damaging critical systems (e.g., weapons, movement, sensors).
- Critical hit check: Roll 2d6 to see if a critical hit occurs on a damaged location.
  - Roll a 7+ to cause a critical hit, triggering specific system malfunctions (e.g., engine damage, weapon destruction).
  
## Heat Phase
- Heat generation: Add heat for any weapons or movement that generate heat.
  - Heat penalties: Too much heat causes shutdowns or heat damage.
- Heat tracking: Keep track of heat levels and monitor for overheating.

## End Phase
- Check for forced shutdowns: If heat exceeds maximum, forced shutdown occurs.
- Repair and recovery: Units can repair damaged systems or reheat weapons as needed for future turns.
- End of round: Begin a new initiative phase and repeat steps.

## Special Rules
- Mechs with high armor or structure may survive long enough to return fire.
- Mechs with specialized equipment (e.g., ECM, special movement modes) have unique modifiers.
