Open Files in Tabs:

Windows (Splits) in Vim

Splitting Windows:

Example: :split myfile.txt opens myfile.txt in a new horizontal split.
:vsplit: Open a vertical split of the current file.
Example: :vsplit config.yaml.

Ctrl-w Navigation, move between Windows:
=> w (cycle all windows), h (left), j (down), k (up), l (right)

Ctrl-w Resizing Windows:
=> + (inc height), - (dec height), > (inc width), < (dec width), = (equalise all).

:q Close the current window.
Ctrl-w c: Close the current window.

Advanced Split Management

Open a New File in a Split:
:sp filename: Open filename in a horizontal split.
:vsp filename: Open filename in a vertical split.
Swap Windows:

Ctrl-w r: Rotate windows to the right.
Ctrl-w R: Rotate windows to the left.

Quick Navigation Tips

Show Open Files in Tabs or Splits:
:tabdo: Run a command in all tabs.
Example: :tabdo %s/foo/bar/g replaces "foo" with "bar" in all tabs.
:windo: Run a command in all windows.
Example: :windo diffthis enables a diff view in all windows.

Navigate Between Split Windows Efficiently:
Use Ctrl-w shortcuts (h, j, k, l) to quickly navigate.
Practical Use Cases

Compare Two Files:
Open both files in vertical splits: :vsp file1 | vsplit file2.
Enable diff view: :windo diffthis.

Work With Multiple Projects:
Use tabs for projects: :tabedit project1/main.c, :tabedit project2/main.c.
Use splits within each tab for related files.

Edit Large Files:
Split the same file into two views: :vsplit and scroll to different parts for cross-referencing.
