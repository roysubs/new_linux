TimeShift is very easy to use, --create / --restore
By default, --create / --restore ignore /home

# sudo timeshift --create
# sudo timeshift --restore

Just be aware of the GRUB2 re-installation step and the effect on
/etc/fstab of performing a snapshort restore.

# Re-install GRUB2 bootloader? (recommended) (y/n): y
# 
# Select GRUB device:
# 
# Num     Device  Description
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 0    >  sda     ATA ST32000542AS [MBR]
# 1    >  sda1     ext4, 1999.4 GB GB
# 2    >  sdb     ATA SAMSUNG HD103UJ [MBR]
# 3    >  sdc     ATA SAMSUNG HD103UJ [MBR]
# 
# [ENTER = Default (/dev/sda), a = Abort]
# 
# Enter device name or number (a=Abort):

The GRUB device typically goes to the drive containing the bootloader, which is usually
the primary drive used to boot the system, i.e. it should be installed to /sda (option 0)
and not to /sda1, since that is most likely to be the default boot drive.
Key Points to Consider: Choose the Whole Disk, Not a Partition, as GRUB is installed in
the Master Boot Record (MBR) of the disk, not within a specific partition, while
/dev/sda1 refers to a partiton, and GRUB does not belong there unless you're doing a very
specific EFI or custom setup.

/etc/fstab:

After the restore, Linux may go into emergency boot mode as the /etc/fstab may contain
drives (sdb / sdc) that were not there when the snapshot was created. To fix this, go into
emergency boot and edit /etc/fstab to remove the drives that were not there, or edit the
/etc/fstab inside the TimeShift snapshot before restoring it. To do this, run Timeshift
with the browse option to access the snapshot files:

sudo timeshift --restore

When prompted, select the snapshot you want to restore but do not proceed with the
restoration. Instead, note where it mounts the snapshot (e.g., /run/timeshift/...) and
from that, locate and edit the fstab File:

cd /run/timeshift/[snapshot_path]/backup/etc
sudo vi fstab

Remove the entries that you think may not be in the current configuration (drives can be
re-added later after the restore completes).

If you want to find the correct UUIDs for your partitions, run:

blkid

Replace device names (e.g., /dev/sdb) in fstab with their corresponding UUIDs:

UUID=<your-partition-uuid>  /mount-point  ext4  defaults  0  1

This ensures the entries are independent of device names, avoiding issues caused by device renaming. Double-check the updated fstab for accuracy and save the file (Ctrl + O, then Ctrl + X to exit nano).

sudo timeshift --restore

This time, the updated fstab file will be applied during the restoration.

Alternatively, you can just modify during Emergency Mode by pressing Ctrl + D or log in as root and then edit /etc/fstab:

To mount the root filesystem in read-write mode:

mount -o remount,rw /

Edit /etc/fstab directly:

vi /etc/fstab

Then reboot to complete the fix.

reboot

Updating fstab in the snapshot ensures the restored system will boot without requiring emergency fixes.
